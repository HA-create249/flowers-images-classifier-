# Flowers Images Classifier üå∏üåªüå∫

## Overview

This project is a deep learning-based image classifier that can identify different types of flowers from images. The classifier is built using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques and can serve as a foundation for various applications in botany, gardening apps, or educational tools.

## Features

- üñºÔ∏è Image classification for multiple flower species
- üß† Built with modern deep learning frameworks
- ‚öôÔ∏è Customizable model architecture
- üìä Performance evaluation metrics
- üöÄ Ready for deployment in applications

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (specify which framework is used)
- OpenCV for image processing
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HA-create249/flowers-images-classifier.git
   cd flowers-images-classifier
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training the Model
```python
python train.py --data_dir path/to/dataset --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
```

### Evaluating the Model
```python
python evaluate.py --model_path models/best_model.h5 --test_dir path/to/test_data
```

### Making Predictions
```python
python predict.py --model_path models/best_model.h5 --image_path path/to/image.jpg
```

## Dataset

The model is trained on the [Flower Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition) (or specify your dataset). The dataset contains images of flowers belonging to X different classes:

- Rose
- Sunflower
- Daisy
- Tulip
- ... 

## Model Architecture

The classifier uses a [specify architecture, e.g., "custom CNN" or "modified ResNet50"] architecture with the following specifications:

- Input size: 224x224 RGB images
- Base model: [specify if using transfer learning]
- Additional layers: [describe any custom layers]
- Output: Softmax layer with X units (one per flower class)
